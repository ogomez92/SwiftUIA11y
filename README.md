# SwiftUIA11Y

This is a set of views to show how to best make content accessible to screen readers.

They are designed in a way so that you can just paste the ContentView.swift into your project (which already includes a ContentView.swift file) and inmediately see the project.

Having said this, I will try to include all views in the same file whenever possible so you can just replace your ContentView with the contents of the file.

I understand this is not clean code, but for simplicity I am doing it this way.

When coding real applications it is a good practice to try and follow patterns like the [Model View View Model](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/books/ios-swiftui/introducing-mvvm-into-your-swiftui-project) structure.

## Structure

The project is divided into folders, for example `01 Single-tab application with a list`, which has a `ContentView.swift` file and in some cases a README.md with some explanations.

Sometimes there might be subfolders like good_example and bad_example which illustrate bad practices for screen reader users.

## Contributions

Contributions are welcome, and of course fixes, corrections, etc.

Feel free to fork and submit pull requests and try to follow the structure of the project as closely as possible.
